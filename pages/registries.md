| [Target](http://www.target.com/wedd/registry/r8Shzur-i8FFoZyyrXkrXg) | [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/9UUO10L8NPGO) | [Bed Bath & Beyond](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?WRN=-884863864) |

You don't have to give us a gift but if you do feel free to use these as guides to see what we like or select something straight off the lists.  We do have several things from IKEA on the Amazon list. While most things you cannot buy online from IKEA we do like the store.  If you so desire to get us stuff from there but don't want to deal with the hassle (it is in Orlando) then get us a gift card (or have someone else who is going get you a gift card) or tag money for a certain thing and we will more than gladly fetch it on your behalf.

If you do not like shopping but still want to give something, money or a gift card will not be turned away. Don't have any money? That is ok too. While gifts are much appreciated we appreciate you just being a part of the celebration. You where invited because we care about you and just showing up is a gift all in its own.
