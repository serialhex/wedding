According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP_(invitations)) and [Emily Post](http://www.emilypost.com/social-life/invitations-and-announcements/153-invitation-etiquette-), it is incredibly rude, akin to spitting on ones face if one does not reply "within a day or two of receiving the invitation".  So the invitations are going out on - blah blah blah - and if you don't respond by - blah, you are rude!!!  :P
