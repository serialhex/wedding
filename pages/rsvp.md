According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP_(invitations)) and [Emily Post](http://www.emilypost.com/social-life/invitations-and-announcements/153-invitation-etiquette-), it is incredibly rude if one does not reply "within a day or two of receiving the invitation".  So get back to us __*A.S.A.P.!!!!!*__
