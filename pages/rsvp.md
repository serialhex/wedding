According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSVP_(invitations)) and [Emily Post](http://www.emilypost.com/social-life/invitations-and-announcements/153-invitation-etiquette-), it is incredibly rude, akin to spitting on ones face if one does not reply "within a day or two of receiving the invitation".  So the invitations are going out on - blah blah blah - and if you don't respond by - blah, you are rude!!!  :P

<form>

  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="can't wait">I can't wait!!  I'm more excited than the groom!!!<br>
  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="be there">I'll be there, and I think it'll be awesome!<br>
  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="i guess">I guess I'll be there, free food and all...<br>
  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="maybe">Maybe... depends what I'm doing.<br>
  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="no">I won't be there, sorry :'(<br>
  <input type="radio" name="coming" value="absolutely not">I'm planning on being out of the county/state/country/off-planet that week, and so I won't be able to make it!!!<br>

  How many are you bringing with you?<br>
